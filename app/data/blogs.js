      "Creating my first developer portfolio was a big milestone in my learning journey. At first, I felt overwhelmed by all the technologies involved, but step by step, everything started to make sense.",

      "I chose Next.js because it offers a powerful structure, fast performance, and modern routing using the App Router. Combined with Tailwind CSS, I was able to focus on building clean layouts without worrying too much about custom CSS.",

      "One of the most important lessons I learned was the importance of structure. Organizing components, pages, and data properly makes the project easier to scale and maintain.",

      "Animations using Framer Motion helped bring the portfolio to life. Simple transitions made the interface feel smoother and more professional without being distracting.",

      "This portfolio is not the end—it's the beginning. I plan to keep improving it as my skills grow and as I learn new technologies."

      "What I learned while starting with Next.js, including routing, layouts, and real-world project structure.",
    content: [
      "When I first started learning Next.js, the file-based routing system felt confusing. However, after practicing, it became one of my favorite features.",

      "Understanding the App Router was a turning point. Layouts, pages, and dynamic routes helped me structure applications more clearly.",

      "Next.js taught me how real-world React applications are built. It is not just about components, but also about data flow, performance, and user experience.",

      "Mistakes were part of the process. Errors like module not found or params issues helped me understand how Next.js works under the hood.",

      "For beginners, my advice is simple: build small projects, break things, fix them, and keep going."
